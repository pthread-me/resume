\opening{Dear Hiring Committee,}

Please accept my application for the advertised software engineering position (ref NO. JB-041425). I am confident
that my experience in low level programming and advanced algorithms would allow me to provide a meaningful contribution to
your team.

My background includes working with Python in both networking programming, as part of my Honours research at Dalhousie, and 
in general scripting as I often used it in conjunction with Bash to write scripts that automated the process of managing 
students' git repositories (on gitlab) as part of my teaching assistant role.

Moreover, I have substantial experience in working with C++, with one of the recent projects I worked on included
collaboration with data compression experts to implement a novel succient data structure using C++ (and the SDSL library).

Finally, as part of my honours research, I worked on writing embedded networking applications for the esp32 devices using 
RIOT-OS which is a realtime operating system for embedded devices, though my work on them was brief, it allowed me to develop important skills
in self learning purely using software documentation and manuals.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your reply and the chance to further discuss how my
background and enthusiasm can benifit the team. 


\closing{Sincerely,}
\end{letter}
